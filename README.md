# Travel Dash 0.2.0

## A Travelling companion written in Flutter.

Simple Flutter Currency Converter based on Rivaan Ranawat's UI, but with functional currency conversion,
geo-location services and weather.

## Getting Started

This is my first Flutter project. As I was following tutorials, I enjoyed Rivaan's currency converter approach and
decided to make it a bit more useful. 

## Things added:
- [FreeCurrencyAPI Services](https://freecurrencyapi.com/)
- [Geo-Location Services](https://pub.dev/packages/geolocator) and
- [Geo-Coding Services](https://pub.dev/packages/geocoding)
- [OpenWeatherMap API Services](https://openweathermap.org/)

## To install (in a terminal):
```
- clone repository
- cd into repository
- type 'flutter build apk --split-per-abi' 
```

## Feedback:
### Yes, please!
### I hope you will find the idea useful. Any changes or suggestions welcome.
